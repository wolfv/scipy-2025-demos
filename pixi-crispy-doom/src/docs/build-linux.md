Compilation on Debian systems (Debian 10 "buster" or later) should be as simple as

```
 sudo apt install build-essential automake git
 sudo apt build-dep crispy-doom
```

to install the prerequisites and then

```
 cd crispy-doom
 autoreconf -fiv
 ./configure
 make
```

After successful compilation the resulting binaries can be found in the `src/` directory.
